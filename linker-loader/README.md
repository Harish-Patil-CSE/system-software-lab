## To run pass one in one command:

`gcc -o pass-1.exe pass-1.c && ./pass-1.exe`

## To run pass 2 in one command:

`gcc -o pass-2.exe pass-2.c && ./pass-2.exe`

# Object code instructions in `object_programs.txt` should NOT be seperated by spaces or a carat (`^`) symbol, else pass 2 implementation fails.
